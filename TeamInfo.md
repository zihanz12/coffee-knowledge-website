## Project Summary
Our project aims to provide a one-stop information site about coffee. More specifically, we will provide information about coffee types, ingredients and nutritional content, coffee bean varieties, etc., for all kinds of users - from novice coffee drinkers to coffee lovers. At the same time, our site will allow users to interact with the content and with each other, including searching for coffee related info, favoriting content, sharing ideas via post, and commenting on othersâ€™ posts.

Our website will be divided into three sections: Coffee Lab, Coffee Fact, and Coffee Forum to achieve the above functionalities. Our current plan is to use react.js for the front-end site, flask and python for the backend development and middleware connection, and MySQL for the database management and remote hosting on AWS or GCP. (The choice of database tech stack may change at a later stage depending on the project requirements)
